# Banhammer.py
By [Mariavi](https://dan6erbond.github.io/mariavi)

Banhammer.py is a framework that allows you to build your very own Banhammer! _Banhammer_ is the concept that got Mariavi started and pursues the goal of bringing subreddit moderation to your very own Discord server. The idea is to have a bot stream any and all moderatable items to Discord channels and allow users to then moderate the subreddit through a joint bot account using **Reactions**.
